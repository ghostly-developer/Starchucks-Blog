# Starchucks-Blog

My first React application that I made. Continuing with the Starchucks theme, I made a blog about the world-famous coffee chain, Starchucks. Fully functional and responsive.

## Dependencies

- Used create-react-app
- Used gh-pages module to deploy the website

## Notes:

When visitng the deployed website, it will show you a 404 Page, fixing this problem soon. Click the 'back to home' link to continue.
